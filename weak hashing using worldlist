Weak Hashing Using a Wordlist (Dictionary Attack)

A wordlist attack works when passwords are hashed using weak or fast hash algorithms (like MD5 or SHA-1) without salt.

Attackers don’t “crack” the hash directly — they:

Take a list of common passwords (wordlist)

Hash each word using the same algorithm

Compare the result with the stored hash

If it matches → password is found

Example Scenario (Weak System ❌)

Hash algorithm: MD5

Salt: None

Stored hash:

5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99


This hash corresponds to:

password


An attacker can find this instantly using a wordlist.

Example: Weak Hashing with Wordlist (Python Demo)


import hashlib

# Weak hash stored in database (MD5 of "password")
stored_hash = "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99"

# Simple wordlist
wordlist = ["123456", "admin", "password", "qwerty"]

for word in wordlist:
    hash_word = hashlib.md5(word.encode()).hexdigest()
    if hash_word == stored_hash:
        print("Password found:", word)
        break

Output:
Password found: password

Why This Works ❌

MD5 is fast

No salt is used

Common passwords exist in wordlists

Attackers can test millions per second

Why Strong Hashing Stops This ✅

Strong algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2:

Use unique salts

Are slow

Require high CPU/memory

Make wordlist attacks impractical

Even if the attacker has the wordlist, matching becomes extremely difficult.
