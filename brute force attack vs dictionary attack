brute force attack is a method where an attacker systematically tries all possible combinations of passwords or keys until the correct one is found. It relies on computing power rather than intelligence or wordlists.

How a Brute Force Attack Works

Attacker selects a target account or password hash

All possible character combinations are generated
(e.g., a–z, A–Z, 0–9, symbols)

Each combination is tested one by one

When a match is found, access is gained

Example

If a password is 4 characters long using only lowercase letters:

Total combinations = 
26
4
=
456
,
976
26
4
=456,976

A computer can try these very quickly

Longer passwords increase difficulty exponentially.

Types of Brute Force Attacks

Simple brute force – tries every possible combination

Hybrid attack – brute force + wordlist (e.g., password123)

Credential stuffing – uses leaked username/password pairs

Reverse brute force – tries one password against many accounts

Why Brute Force Attacks Succeed

Short or simple passwords

No login attempt limits

Fast hash algorithms

Weak or no password policies

Prevention Techniques

Use long, complex passwords

Implement account lockout or rate limiting

Use strong password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)

Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Add CAPTCHAs after failed attemptsBrute Force Attack vs Dictionary Attack
Feature	Brute Force Attack	Dictionary Attack
Definition	Tries all possible character combinations	Tries passwords from a predefined wordlist
Approach	Exhaustive and systematic	Selective and intelligent
Speed	Very slow for long passwords	Faster than brute force
Password Knowledge	No prior knowledge needed	Uses common or leaked passwords
Effectiveness	Guaranteed success if time allows	Only works if password is in the list
Computational Cost	Very high	Moderate
Example	aaaa → aaab → aaac …	password, admin, 123456
Best Against	Short, simple passwords	Common or reused passwords
Key Differences in Simple Words

Brute force = try everything

Dictionary = try likely passwords

Prevention (Both Attacks)

Long and complex passwords

Strong password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)

Account lockout / rate limiting

Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Exam-Ready Summary

A brute force attack attempts all possible password combinations, while a dictionary attack uses a list of commonly used passwords. Brute force is more time-consuming but guarantees success, whereas dictionary attacks are faster but limited to the words in the list.
