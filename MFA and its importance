Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Its Importance

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security mechanism that requires users to verify their identity using two or more independent factors before gaining access to a system. It adds extra layers of protection beyond just a username and password.

Types of Authentication Factors

MFA typically combines factors from different categories:

Something you know

Password, PIN

Something you have

OTP (One-Time Password), smart card, mobile phone, security token

Something you are

Fingerprint, face recognition, iris scan

How MFA Works

User enters username and password

System requests an additional factor (e.g., OTP or biometric)

Access is granted only if all factors are verified

Importance of MFA

Protects against stolen passwords
Even if a password is compromised, attackers cannot log in without the second factor.

Reduces brute force and dictionary attacks
Additional verification blocks automated login attempts.

Prevents phishing attacks
Stolen credentials alone are not enough to access accounts.

Enhances data security
Protects sensitive information in banking, healthcare, and corporate systems.

Meets compliance requirements
Required by many security standards and regulations.

Real-World Examples of MFA

ATM card + PIN

Online banking password + OTP

Phone unlock using PIN + fingerprint
