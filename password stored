1. Hashing (Core Method)

When a user creates a password, the system runs it through a hash function.

A hash converts the password into a fixed-length string of characters.

This process is one-way — the original password cannot be reversed.

Example (conceptual):
mypassword → X9fA3kL...

Common secure hash algorithms:

bcrypt

Argon2 (recommended)

PBKDF2

scrypt

2. Salting (Extra Protection)

A salt is a random value added to the password before hashing.

Each user gets a unique salt.

This prevents attackers from using precomputed tables (rainbow tables).

Example:
password + random_salt → hash

The salt is stored alongside the hash in the database.

3. Password Verification (Login Time)

When a user logs in, the system:

Takes the entered password

Adds the stored salt

Hashes it again

Compares it with the stored hash

If they match → access granted.

4. Key Stretching

Secure systems intentionally make hashing slow by running it many times.

This makes brute-force attacks far more difficult.

Algorithms like bcrypt and Argon2 handle this automatically.

5. What NOT to Do ❌

Store passwords in plain text

Use fast hash functions like MD5 or SHA-1

Reuse the same salt for all users

Encrypt passwords instead of hashing them

6. Example Database Entry (Simplified)
username | salt         | password_hash
----------------------------------------
alice    | r@nd0m!23    | $argon2id$..
