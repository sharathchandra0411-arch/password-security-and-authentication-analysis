Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Combine at least two factors (password + OTP/biometric) to add extra security.

Enforce Strong Password Policies

Minimum length (12–16 characters)

Mix of letters, numbers, and symbols

Avoid common or reused passwords

Use Secure Password Hashing
Store passwords using bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2 with salting and key stretching.

Implement Account Lockout and Rate Limiting
Temporarily lock accounts or slow login attempts after multiple failures.

Use Biometric Authentication Where Possible
Fingerprint or facial recognition provides stronger identity verification.

Enable Password Managers
Encourage users to generate and store complex, unique passwords securely.

Protect Against Phishing
Use MFA, user awareness training, and phishing-resistant authentication methods.

Regularly Update and Monitor Systems
Apply security patches and monitor login activity for suspicious behavior.

Use Secure Communication Channels
Ensure authentication data is transmitted over HTTPS/TLS.

Apply the Principle of Least Privilege
Grant users only the access necessary for their roles.
