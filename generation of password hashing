User enters a password

System generates a random salt

Password + salt are passed to a password hashing algorithm

The resulting hash is stored in the database

Password → Hashing Algorithm (+ Salt) → Hashed Password

Example 1: Password Hashing in Python (bcrypt) ✅
import bcrypt

# User password (plain text)
password = "MySecurePassword123"

# Convert to bytes
password_bytes = password.encode('utf-8')

# Generate salt and hash password
hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password_bytes, bcrypt.gensalt())

print("Hashed Password:", hashed_password)

Verifying the password
# Check password during login
if bcrypt.checkpw(password_bytes, hashed_password):
    print("Password is correct")
else:
    print("Password is incorrect")

Example 2: Password Hashing in Python (Argon2 – Recommended) ⭐
from argon2 import PasswordHasher

ph = PasswordHasher()

password = "MySecurePassword123"

# Hash the password
hash = ph.hash(password)
print("Hashed Password:", hash)

# Verify password
ph.verify(hash, password)

Example 3: Password Hashing in PHP
$password = "MySecurePassword123";

// Hash password
$hashed_password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);

echo $hashed_password;

Important Notes ❗

Never store plain text passwords

Never use MD5 or SHA-1

Always use bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2

Hashing ≠ Encryption (hashing cannot be reversed)
